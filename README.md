# land-use-zoning-checks
QA and cleaning of zoning data

Consistent zoning data is required in order to understand land use. 

The scripts in this repository support work to combine legacy zoning data according to a standard. 

When combining data in order to achieve this standard, there may be missing information. The goal of the scripts in this repository is to identify which information is missing so that we can find it and improve the quality of our analysis. 

Requirements to use these scripts include PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Python (psycopg2), and GDAL.
